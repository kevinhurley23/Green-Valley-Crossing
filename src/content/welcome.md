Welcome to the online home of Green Valley Crossing. We know that
connecting with a new church can be a daunting task, and we're glad
that you are here. As you browse this site, our prayer is that you
would discover how you can fit into God's story for the quiet corner
of Connecticut. We believe He has a great plan for your life, and
we're excited to help you experience Jesus in a fresh way.
